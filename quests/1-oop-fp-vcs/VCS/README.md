# Quest 1 - Version Control Systems

## Introduction

Version or **source control** is the best practice of **tracking and managing changes** **to software code** but lately goes even beyond just that, e.g. version control of assets, content, and even using it as a fully-fledged CMS.

No one can control the chaos of software development without the help of the powerful version control systems and our school of choice is [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Assessment #1

In this assessment you are provided with the function `git()`. Your tasks are to:

- Create a new branch

- Change the `git()` function is such way that it returns the string `"Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management."`

- Commit the changed file

- Rebase your branch with `feature/john-doe-solution`

- Resolve the conflict is such way that you keep your changes but also John Doe's changes.

- Push the branch to remote

In order to successfully complete the assessment you have to follow the best practices and naming conventions. If you have completed all steps and all unit tests pass you can expect a success message in the terminal after you push to remote. Otherwise you will see an error message and you will have to start over again.
