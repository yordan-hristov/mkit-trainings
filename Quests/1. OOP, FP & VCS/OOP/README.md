In this task you are provided with the starting of a definition for a `Shape` class. This class only models shapes for which all sides are the same length, like a square or an equilateral triangle.

- Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes arguments for the `name`, `sides`, and `sideLength` properties, and initializes them.

- Add a new `calcPerimeter()` method to the class, which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console.

The created class will be then tested to check if the above methods/properties are properly implemented.
