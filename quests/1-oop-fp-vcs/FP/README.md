In this task you are provided with three functions `map`, `filter` and `reduce`. All of the mentioned functions will receive an array of numbers. Your objective is to:

- Implement `map` in such a way that it returns an array in which all numbers are mutiplied by 2.

- Implement `filter` in such a way that it returns an array containing only even numbers.

- Implement `reduce` in such a way that it returns the total sum of all the numbers.

Your solution will be tested so that it's verified that it works.
